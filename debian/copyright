 THE FRONTIER ARTISTIC LICENSE Version 1.0
 Copyright (c) 1999 by Samuel Reynolds.
 Derived from the "Artistic License" at "OpenSource.org".
 Submitted to OpenSource.org for Open Source Initiative certification.
 .
 PREAMBLE
 .
 The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
 Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
 semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
 while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
 the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to
 make reasonable modifications.
 .
 DEFINITIONS
 .
 o   "Package" refers to the script, suite, file, or collection of scripts,
     suites, and/or files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and to
     derivatives of that Package created through textual modification.
 .
 o   "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
     modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the
     Copyright Holder.
 .
 o   "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright statement or
     statements for the package.
 .
 o   "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this
     Package.
 .
 o   "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of
     media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on.
     (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but
     only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the
     fee.)
 .
 o   "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself,
     though there may be fees involved in handling the item.  It also means
     that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same
     conditions they received it.
 .
 TERMS
 .
 1.  You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
     Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
     duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
 .
 2.  You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes, and other modifications
     derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
     modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
 .
 3.  You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
     that you insert a prominent notice in each changed script, suite, or file
     stating how and when you changed that script, suite, or file, and provided
     that you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
     a) Use the modified Package only within your corporation or
     organization, or retain the modified Package solely for personal use.
 .
     b) Place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
     Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an
     equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site
     such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your
     modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
 .
     c) Rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
     with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a
     separate manual page (or equivalent) for each non-standard executable
     that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
 .
     d) Make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
 4.  You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
     executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
     a) Distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
     together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
     to get the Standard Version.
 .
     b) Accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the
     Package with your modifications.
 .
     c) Accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding
     Standard Version executables, give the non-standard executables
     non-standard names, and clearly document the differences in manual
     pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the
     Standard Version.
 .
     d) Make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
 5.  You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
     Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package.
     You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However, you may
     distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial)
     programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution
     provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.
 .
 6.  The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
     output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under
     the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and
     may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.
 .
 7.  Scripts, suites, or programs supplied by you that depend on or
     otherwise make use of this Package shall not be considered part of this
     Package.
 .
 8.  The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
     products derived from this software without specific prior written
     permission.
 .
 9.  THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
     WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
